# Analyze Jumpstats

Quick script I made to analyze your jumpstats from a CSV file. \
Best to use with [CSGO Telnet jumpstats example](https://github.com/everlyy/csgo-telnet/blob/main/examples/jumpstats.py).

# How to use

Put all your jumpstat CSV files in a folder called `stats` and then just run the program.
