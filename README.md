# Analyze Jumpstats

Quick script I made to analyze your jumpstats from a CSV file. \
Best to use with [CSGO Telnet jumpstats example](https://github.com/everlyy/csgo-telnet/blob/main/examples/jumpstats.py).

# How To Use

Put all your jumpstat CSV files in a folder called `stats` and then just run `AnalyzeJumpstats.py`. 

For help with command-line arguments, just run the program with `--help`.
